# SideShift operations

Use the installed SideShift MCP server as the authoritative interface. Do not replace it with scraped pages, guessed REST calls, direct database access, or another company's credentials.

## Establish the operating context

1. Call `whoami` before the first substantive operation in a task.
2. State the connected company and whether the required scope is present.
3. For any write or sensitive operation, verify the company again immediately before execution if the session may have changed.
4. If authorization is missing, direct the user through `/sideshift-connect`. Never request that the user paste an access token, refresh token, API key, cookie, or client secret into chat.

## Select tools from the authoritative catalog

1. Use an obvious visible typed tool when it exactly matches the request.
2. If no visible tool clearly matches, call `find_capability` with the user's ordinary-language intent. The legacy `catalog_search` name is equivalent.
3. Do not conclude that SideShift lacks a capability until catalog search returns no suitable match.
4. Call `catalog_get_schema` for the exact selected capability before a configurable or consequential action.
5. Invoke discovered capabilities only through the matching risk gate: `catalog_invoke_read`, `catalog_invoke_write`, or `catalog_invoke_sensitive`.
6. Never guess required fields, enum values, IDs, scope names, or tool outcomes.

## Read, write, and sensitive behavior

### Reads

Run read-only tools when they directly answer the user's request. Preserve material caveats, pagination, freshness indicators, and `not found` or `insufficient data` states.

### Writes

Before a reversible write:

1. Resolve and show the exact target.
2. Load the authoritative schema.
3. Gather every required value.
4. Summarize the material arguments and expected state change.
5. Obtain clear user confirmation.
6. Execute once, then read back the resulting state when a read tool is available.

### Sensitive actions

Treat money movement, external communications, invitations, emails, direct messages, credential changes, destructive operations, and other externally visible actions as sensitive even if the surrounding request seems routine.

- Require explicit approval of the exact target, amount or content, and consequence immediately before execution.
- Never infer approval from a request to draft, inspect, calculate, compare, or prepare.
- Respect sandbox and safe-mode refusals. Do not seek an alternate path around them.
- When a browser handoff is returned, give the link to the user and let the human complete the protected step.

## Retry and evidence rules

- Supply a stable caller-generated `operation_id` or idempotency key for retryable mutations when the schema supports it.
- Reuse the same value for an exact retry. Never generate a new key just because the first result timed out.
- If the outcome is unknown, read current state before another attempt.
- Report only outcomes established by the tool response or a follow-up read. Do not turn an accepted, queued, or pending result into a success claim.
- Preserve request IDs and actionable error details in troubleshooting summaries, without exposing credentials or private data unnecessarily.

## Tenant and privacy boundaries

- Operate only on the company reported by `whoami`.
- Treat `not found` as unknown or not visible to this company; never probe another tenant.
- Keep creator-authored content, contact details, private messages, and company data out of code, commits, issue bodies, logs, and examples unless the user explicitly requests an appropriate export.
- If a required scope is absent, explain the missing scope and ask the user to re-authorize. Never bypass scope enforcement.

## Completion

At the end of a task, distinguish what was read, what was changed, what was confirmed by read-back, and what still needs human action. Include links or IDs returned by SideShift when they help the user verify the result.
